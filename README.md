# Car-Race
Today we will start game development in js. The main thing that we learn in this is the continuous downwards animation of the road. It is done using window.requestAnimationFrame(). Also the different key presses that can be read by using event.key. Also we should address which key is pressed using a global object, which has the left, right, up, down as keys and booleans as values. Also we learned about the z-index which decides which div will be on top. We also saw getBoundingClientRect() to get the exact dimensions of any object. I was not able to figure out many things on my own, like how to create moving lines. I had an idea, but took help from the video. We also saw a function to get random colors each time using hex code. There is also a difficulty increase added.
